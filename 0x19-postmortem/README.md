Postmortem: API Service Outage on August 12, 2024

Issue Summary

    Duration: August 12, 2024, 09:00 - 11:15 UTC
    Impact: The API service was entirely down, affecting approximately 50% of users who experienced errors and inability to retrieve data. This downtime caused disruption for users relying on the API for critical operations.
    Root Cause: An incorrect configuration change in the load balancer caused traffic to be unevenly distributed, leading to server overload and eventual service unavailability.

Timeline

    09:00 UTC: Monitoring system alerted to high error rates and unresponsive servers.
    09:05 UTC: On-call engineer was notified by PagerDuty of the incident.
    09:15 UTC: Initial investigations focused on backend server performance and application logs, assuming the issue was related to server capacity or application code.
    09:30 UTC: Misleading investigation paths included checking for potential DDoS attacks and database issues, which were ruled out as the root cause.
    10:00 UTC: Incident escalated to the Network Operations Team after confirming the problem was related to traffic routing.
    10:30 UTC: Network Operations Team identified and corrected the misconfiguration in the load balancerâ€™s traffic distribution rules.
    11:15 UTC: Service restored and verified stable, with monitoring tools confirming normal operation.

Root Cause and Resolution

    Root Cause: The load balancer was misconfigured to route traffic unevenly, sending excessive traffic to a limited number of backend servers. This overload caused the servers to become unresponsive.
    Resolution: The load balancer configuration was corrected to ensure even traffic distribution across all backend servers. The configuration was then tested and validated to prevent recurrence.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

    Improvements:
        Enhance configuration management processes to include stricter review and validation before changes are applied.
        Implement automated testing for load balancer configurations to identify issues before deployment.
        Improve monitoring and alerting for traffic distribution anomalies and load balancer performance.

    Tasks:
        Review and Update Configuration Management: Implement a detailed review process for configuration changes, including peer reviews and approval workflows.
        Automated Testing Tools: Develop and integrate automated testing tools to simulate and validate load balancer configurations.
        Enhance Monitoring: Update monitoring systems to track detailed traffic patterns and load balancer health, with alerts for any deviations.
        Documentation: Update internal documentation to include best practices for load balancer configuration and incident handling procedures.
